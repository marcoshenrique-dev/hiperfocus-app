# The hiperfocus app⚡ - web and mobile responsive
---

This project was created based in the [Chris Bailey`s Hyper focus book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Hiperfoco-Como-trabalhar-menos-render/dp/8557173040), which demonstrates very interesting concepts such as attentional space, ways to focus more and especially the state of hyperfocus.

From this idea, I developed a website capable of monitoring the focus time on each task. Where the user registers his tasks for the day and starts them using the timer present in the application .

> I developed this project just as a way of studying, but if you want to use it, just access the link: [https://hiperfocus-app.vercel.app](https://hiperfocus-app.vercel.app/)
